v1.11.0
=======
 * [Pro] Add hardware support for FXPAK Pro Rev.D
 * [All] USB (usb2snes) support by RedGuy
 * [All] SGB support by Redacted173
 * [All] save state support (via USB/savestate2snes) by RedGuy, based on code
         by acmlm, total, Myria
 * [All] stand-alone save state features by FURiOUS, with compatibility
         improvements by ikari_01
 * [All] favorite games list by freelancer42
 * **NOTE**: save states are currently only available on games without
         expansion chips.
 * fixes:
   - [All] Fixed data caching bug in MSU1 data extension which could cause wrong
           data to be streamed
   - [All] Savestates: do not try to capture data that is already in cartridge
           space anyway (e.g. SRAM). Fixes text distortion in Near’s Bahamut
           Lagoon translation when loading a state.
   - [All] Fixed YAML config parser to support comment signs after list start
           items
   - [All] Fixed SNES open-bus contamination (fixes sprite flickering in Near’s
           Bahamut Lagoon translation, certain speed runs that rely on open bus
           behaviour)
   - [All] (hopefully) fixed rapid data line toggling sometimes resulting in
           address line glitches, causing random crashes in extreme cases, and
           occasional garbled graphics on SMRPG among others
   - [All] Fixed data integrity problems when loading BSX games

v1.10.3
=======
 * fixes:
   - [Mk2] Revert S-DD1 bitfile to earlier build which happens to less expose a
           timing hazard. This will need further examination for a proper fix.
           Fixes severe glitches with S-DD1
   - [All] Fix swapped logic terms in SA-1 and SuperFX RAM write cycles. Fixes
           severe glitches on SA-1 and SuperFX on Mk.II units; The bug was also
           present in the Pro firmware but didn't seem to have much of an effect
   - [All] Fix game video mode setting in SuperCIC pair mode

v1.10.2
=======
 * fixes:
   - [Pro] fix wrong data ROM size on uPD96050 core -> F1 ROC II track is shown
           properly.
   - [Pro] fix S-DD1 address mirroring -> Star Ocean works
   - [Pro] correct Cx4 core speed from 96MHz to 80MHz
   - [All] apply volume boost after FPGA reconfiguration
           (fixes MSU1 volume boost on Cx4, OBC1, SuperFX, SA-1, S-DD1)
   - [All] fix S-DD1 writes going to the wrong address on concurrent MCU
           accesses (saving not working in Star Ocean)
   - [All] avoid potential data corruption on MCU writes (e.g. SPC loading)
   - [All] Workaround for Super Nt not booting when CIC enters pair mode
           successfully

v1.10.1
=======
 * fix bug preventing boot on sd2snes Mk.III...

v1.10.0
=======
 * add S-DD1 support by magno
 * initial firmware release for sd2snes Mk.III ("sd2snes pro")
 * fixes:
   - fix memory corruption on BS-X loading
   - reset S-RTC read state on all load and reset occasions

v1.9.0
======
 * add SA-1 support by RedGuy
 * add partial SRAM change detection for known games (SuperFX/SA-1) by RedGuy
   this enables sensible autosaving for games that use part SRAM as work RAM,
   without having to resort to periodic saving. I added some more games to the
   known CRC list.
   Note that this feature performs full ROM CRC calculation after loading and
   running the ROM so firmware is unresponsive to in-game hooks and resetting
   for a couple of seconds after the game has started. I have some ideas for
   optimization.
 * add option to always go back to menu when resetting
 * add LED brightness setting
 * add an option to start out with cheats enabled or disabled
 * disable Satellaview emulation when a real Satellaview unit is present to
   avoid conflicts and facilitate Satellaview development
 * add SNES CPU <-> PPU clock phase alignment correction on reset
   (fixes flickering sprite slabs e.g. giant Frog in Chrono Trigger, sprites in
   Kirby Super Star, Star Ocean...)
 * show current effective video mode (50/60Hz) in System Information
 * fixes:
   - earlier signal edge detection, improving stability on some consoles
   - fix timing of auto region patching
   - fix brightness patching for games that use HDMA to set brightness/blanking
   - fix an occasional lockup when loading a game that uses OBC-1/SuperFX/SA-1
   - fix SuperCIC pair mode entry for consoles with <= 3.072MHz CIC clock
   - reset S-RTC register state on reset

v1.8.0
======
 * add SuperFX support by RedGuy (v10)
 * add support for ExLoROM (LoROM > 32 Mbits)
 * disable in-game hooks by default
 * add brightness patching to correct RGB output levels on 1CHIP consoles
 * add mid-screen brightness change fixes for 1CHIP consoles:
   - avoid change of brightness (bits 0-3) when forced blanking is used
   - on bigger brightness change steps, substitute brightness 0
     -> less sync distortion in Rudra's Treasure text boxes
     -> visible shadow in A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol
   - known issue: HDMA writes are not handled correctly
 * some menu improvements:
   - Menu entries can now be printed in grey when some condition is (not)
     met. A function call is used to determine the status with the carry flag
     as a boolean return value. Disabled menu entries can still be changed
     for when they become active again.
   - Also a change hook function can now be used in the menu structure. It is
     called whenever the value is changed during setting, e.g. to immediately
     reflect / preview the setting made.
 * change versioning to eliminate the useless "v0." and gain a meaningful
   subversion at the end

v0.1.7e
=======
 * fix critical DAC timing quirk causing audio distortion with MSU1
 * fix clock glitch on SD card access leading to audio/video distortion
   with MSU1 in rare cases
 * properly map SRAM to banks f0-ff instead of f0-fd in Mode 20 ("LoROM")
   memory map
 * add support for headered bsxbios.bin
 * Slight SD Card read performance optimization for MSU1
   (try and avoid unaligned reads)
 * Change initial SRAM fill value (by devinacker)
   - fixes Ken Griffey Jr., Ou-chan, possibly other games that handle
     checksums badly
 * Always start game on PPU2 field 0
   - Theoretical compatibility improvement

v0.1.7d
=======
 * reworked the in-game hook code again, squeezing out a couple more CPU
   cycles - compatibility improved further
 * BS-X: new bsx page file by LuigiBlood!
   - contains a proper channel map, notably fixes Fuurai no Shiren: Surara o
     sukue and most likely more games
   - enables a great number of town features
 * BS-X: better detection for script-type ROMs (e.g. various magazines)
 * Cx4 SKIP instruction timing sped up a bit. Core felt a bit too slow.
   (this is a makeshift "fix" until I implement the proper Cx4 instruction
    timing I recently figured out)
 * fixes:
   - fixed occasional black screen after soft reset (L+R+Select+Start)
   - in-game hook memory area visibility quirks fixed in various situations,
     notably fixes BS Kirby no Omochabako: Pinball
   - BS-X: fix PSRAM corruption on SNES WRAM writes, fixes a number of
     games, notably BS Kirby no Omochabako: Pinball (tough one)
   - PPU2 H/V count odd/even read flag is reset on ROM load, this fixes
     games that depend on it when run after games that leave it in a dirty
     state - notably audio glitches and freezes in Super Punch-Out when run
     after Fuurai no Shiren.
   - SPC Player: Fixed a long-standing transfer corruption bug that occurred
     because the original bulk transfer routine didn't account for CPU stalls
     by HDMA (which is abundant in the sd2snes menu). This fixes occasionally
     missing instruments, corrupted samples etc.
   - fixed an occasional deadlock on bootup where the menu would hang at the
     "Loading..." screen.
   - fixed hard freeze when selecting a file immediately after disabling the
     "Hide file extensions" option
   - fixed persistent hard freeze in recent games list handling when running
     games with long path names (> ~120 characters)
   - revert DAC I2S timing to pre-v0.1.7c behaviour, hopefully reducing audio
     glitches for sd2snes Rev.G units
   - fixed corrupted file list display after playing an SPC file with a
     scrolled file name
 * cosmetic changes:
   - "Loading" window is replaced by status bar notification to be less
     disruptive with very short load times
   - configuration settings no longer have the wrong color when changed

v0.1.7c
=======
 * reversed changelog order =)
 * reworked the in-game hook code, with more help from the FPGA, to
   significantly reduce CPU footprint. This improves hook compatibility
   with a variety of games.
 * in-game hook: avoid disruption of manual controller reads
   (fixes controls in Super Star Wars games)
 * new option: "Hide file extensions" (effective after next directory change)
 * do not silently fail to load saved games when the sd2snes/saves folder does
   not exist (create the folder instead)
 * do not silently fail to save cheat files when the sd2snes/cheats folder
   does not exist (create the folder instead)
 * Cx4 core now runs at exactly 20Mhz
 * fixes:
   - MSU1: avoid missed control register status changes on rapid rewrites
     (fixes FF3 Dancing Mad, Zelda FMV missing audio)
   - fix $213f register patch timing (hopefully)
   - fix DSP1 header detection (fixes Ballz 3D JPN)
   - add reset hook to boot games on start of frame only (fixes Boogerman PAL)

 * Ultra16 awareness (mostly thanks to borti4938!):
   - show Ultra16 serial number and autoboot setting in the System Information
   - support SPC player warm-boot on Ultra16 consoles
   - prolong soft reset on Ultra16 consoles to prevent accidental entry
     of Ultra16 menu

     graphical corruption on some games (notably Treasure Conflix garbled
     sprites)
   - SRAM mapping for LoROM <=16Mbits now uses the entire bank instead of
     0000-7fff only. Fixes saving in some games, e.g. Ys III Wanderers from Ys


v0.1.5
======
 * Sort directories by entire file name instead of first 20 characters only
 * Correctly map SRAM larger than 8192 bytes (HiROM) / 32768 bytes (LoROM)

     set when an error occurred while preparing playback of the requested audio track
 * write LED stays on when SRAM content changes constantly
 * Fixes:
