SNES Menu Compilation

This directory contains all code for the SD2SNES menu navigation.

snescom (Version 1.8.1.1) is required to build the menu. The source can be downloaded 
here: https://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/snescom.html

To compile snescom/sneslink install libboot-dev-all, then make & make install in the
snescom directory.

After installing snescom, call make in this directory to build the SD2SNES menu.

Copy the resulting file "menu.bin" to <sdcard>/sd2snes/menu.bin.

It's also possible to use (limited) emulation to test the menu. Configurations for
 bsnes-plus are included (menu.xml and menu.cht).

To build bsnes-plus check out https://github.com/devinacker/bsnes-plus.

To compile bsnes the following packages need to be installed:
libqt4-dev libqt4-dev-bin libxv-dev libsdl1.2-dev libao-dev libopenal-dev g++ are required.

After installing the dependencies, run the following commands in the bsnes directory to use Qt4 to build bsnes.

export QT_SELECT=4 
make
make install

The menu can then be tested with

bnes menu.bin

To work with the emulator, two memory addresses must be set via cheat code and an RTC must be configured. RTC is set in the
manifest XML file, while the memory addresses are overwritten in the .cht file.
