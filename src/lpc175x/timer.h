/* Adapted from Linux 2.6 include/linux/jiffies.h:
 *
 *      These inlines deal with timer wrapping correctly. You are
 *      strongly encouraged to use them
 *      1. Because people otherwise forget
 *      2. Because if the timer wrap changes in future you won't have to
 *         alter your driver code.
 *
 * time_after(a,b) returns true if the time a is after time b.
 *
 * Do this with "<0" and ">=0" to only test the sign of the result. A
 * good compiler would generate better code (and a really good compiler
 * wouldn't care). Gcc is currently neither.
 * (">=0" refers to the time_after_eq macro which wasn't copied)
